# Astar-Sandbox
Simple drawing board where you can draw walls and mazes for the A* pathfinding algorithm to solve.

Controls:
  - 'q' selects the start node
  - 'w' selects the walls
  - 'e' selects the end node
  - 'r' selects the eraser
 
 When you finish drawing, press 'a' to load and display the path and any key once finished to erase the path.
